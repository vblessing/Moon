<center><b>Victoria</b> is an artsy, creative trapped in the body of an analytical techie. Some days it's vice versa.</center>


I'm currently working as an Operations Engineer at Texas A&M University. 
I'm using configuration management tools like Chef to manage the Linux infrastructure 
for the College of Architecture. I graduated for Texas A&M in December 2014, with a Management Information Systems 
degree and an Internation Business Certificate. I worked for the College of Architecture as a student worker, 
starting out on the ITS helpdesk as a freshman, and working my way up through various support and development 
roles, before stepping in the Linux sysadmin role the summer before my last semester. It's been a great opportunity 
for me to grow and figure out what I want to do. I love the DevOps culture and mindset and really enjoy using 
tools like Chef to automate infrastructure management.

I grew up on a farm in North Texas, but am now living the big city life with my other half, Ben, in Space City: Houston, TX. 
We have 4 fur babies: a gorgeous German Shepherd, Elsa, a precious little Jack Russell Terrier mix, Oliver, 
and two lazy fat cats, Jasper and Billie Jean. It's quite a zoo, but we wouldn't have it any other way.

I have a wide range of passions, from cooking, to sewing, knitting, crocheting, anything crafty, 
to things like robotics and model rocketry. I can fix anything. I also love camping and any activity 
in the great outdoors. I have major wanderlust, I feel most at home when I'm traveling and experiencing new places 
and new cultures, espcially when it comes to food. My one problem is the lack of time to do all the things I want to do. What I would give for more 
hours in the day.

But I enjoy the time I do get doing the things I love, and being with the ones I love!
