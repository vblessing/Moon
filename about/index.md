<center><b>Victoria</b> is an artsy, creative trapped in the body of an analytical techie. Some days it's vice versa.</center>


I'm currently working as a Unix Systems Administrator for the Maquarie Group. I graduated for Texas
A&M in December 2014, with a Management Information Systems 
degree and an Internation Business Certificate. I worked for the College of Architecture as a student worker, 
starting out on the ITS helpdesk as a freshman, and working my way up through various support and development 
roles, before stepping in the Linux sysadmin role the summer before my last semester. Spending three
years in that was an invaluable opportunity for me to grow and figure out what I want to do. I love
the DevOps culture and mindset and really enjoy using automation and configuration management
tools.

I grew up on a farm in North Texas, and after spending a couple years living the Houston big city life with my other
half, Ben, in Houston. I'm finally living out where the sky is big and the air is clean, since we
bought a house out on the west edge of Montgomery County. It makes for a hell of a commute, but
nothing beats the country. 
We have 4 fur babies: a gorgeous German Shepherd, Elsa, a precious little Jack Russell Terrier mix, Oliver, 
and two lazy fat cats, Jasper and Billie Jean. It's quite a zoo, but we wouldn't have it any other way.

I have a wide range of passions, from cooking, to sewing, knitting, crocheting, anything crafty, 
to things like robotics and model rocketry. I can fix anything. I also love camping and any activity 
in the great outdoors. I have major wanderlust, I feel most at home when I'm traveling and experiencing new places 
and new cultures, espcially when it comes to food. My one problem is the lack of time to do all the
things I want to do. What I would give for more hours in the day.

But I enjoy the time I do get doing the things I love, and being with the ones I love!
